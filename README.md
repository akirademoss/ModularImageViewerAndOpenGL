# ModularImageViewerAndOpenGL

## Basic overview
After playing around with JUCE for a couple days, I realized there were some major drawbacks to the layout system.  After some researching (okay, I admit, just a lot of google searching) I was fortunate enough to encounter several clever folks had drafted up  some solutions to this issue so here is a basic proof of concept illustrating the usefulness of these dock-able windows developed by [Jim](https://github.com/jcredland) with a tangible use case developed by myself.
